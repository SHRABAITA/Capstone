# Retail Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue in the retail industry. Predicting churn helps retail businesses retain customers by identifying at-risk individuals early and offering targeted interventions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a retail setting, leveraging retail analytics to inform data-driven decisions.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will return to the business, enabling the company to take targeted actions to increase customer loyalty and minimize churn. By exploring various machine learning models and analytical techniques, I aim to create a reliable predictive model that aids in customer retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Open-source retail dataset
- **Purpose:** To analyze customer behavior and predict churn

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I have extensively analyzed the dataset to understand:
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examining individual variables using histograms, box plots, and summary statistics.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Understanding relationships between two variables using scatter plots, line graphs, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Exploring complex interactions between multiple features.

**Techniques Used:**
- Box plots, scatter plots, line and bar graphs, correlation plots
- Box-Cox transformation for handling skewed variables
- Chi-square test for categorical variables
- Multicollinearity test to identify correlated features

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
To compare the performance of different models, I have trained multiple classification algorithms, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Naïve Bayes**

Additionally, I experimented with:
- **SMOTEEN**: Used for handling class imbalances, although the dataset is balanced
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied to observe changes in accuracy

## 🚀 Model Evaluation
Each model's performance is evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- AUC-ROC Curve
- Feature importance analysis

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook



## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model selection
- Deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI
